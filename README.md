# A little insight into Awwal
I am a software developer and technical engineer specializing in Python and Java (among other tools and technologies).
This README will give you a bit of information about me.

## The journey so far...
I wrote and compiled my first lines of code in October 2017, and that journey led me to the creation of what you see before you - a curated list of repositories.
I specialize in Python and Java programming (mainly) and have applied these in a number of areas not limited to: 
data miing/web scraping, Android development, and a bit of machine learning.
Adding to this, I've also worked on RFID engineering.
